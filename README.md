# week6-weather-dashboard

## Description

I wanted to create an application that would test my skills using API's to fetch data and display it. This project really allowed me to explore the power of API data fetched using JavaScript's Fetch method and how to traverse the DOM and use the data to provide accurate information to the user. I was also excited to apply previous skills involving local storage and creating/appending elements through use of dynamic JavaScript. I hope others enjoy using this app to find current and future weather information for their city of choice. I learned that the data pulled from an API can be used in many different ways. I was able to learn how to substitute variables in the API header through use of temperste literals, that make data fetching very versatile and much easier to read for other coders. I also felt my knowledge of dynamic JavaScript has improved, providing a much cleaner code for future devs.

## Credits

I would like to give a shoutout to Scott Everett, my tutor, for really helping me understandAPI's and how to work with them.

I used <https://www.w3schools.com/> and <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/> to search how to use the functions in my code properly to achieve the desired results.

I used the <https://openweathermap.org/forecast5> API for all of the data provided in this application.
